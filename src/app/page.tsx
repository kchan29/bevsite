    content: `dear bianca,
wishing you the best 20th ever!! we met when we were little naive 18-year olds and now we're both 20 that's actually crazy. it feels like just yesterday we were coming to berkeley for the first time and somehow i was lucky enough to have met you as my first friend in college. from the beginning, i was drawn to you because there was something about you that made me feel so safe. i immediately felt that i could tell you anything and you wouldn't judge me. you became a constant, reliable support system and one of my biggest comforts throughout college. being your roommate was such a special part of my college experience and i'm so lucky that we somehow ended up as random roomies.
we've shared so so many fun memories together. there's too many to put into words, but i can try. forcing ourselves to tolerate clark kerr food but ending up making noodles (indome and maggi>>). dressing up as white/black swan and ravenclaw/hufflepuff, then realizing how good shein is (which didn't help our already horrible self control when it comes to shopping). buying an unhealthy amount of cal jacketsâ€¦ watching things together (can't believe we lasted through an entire season of xo kitty in one sitting). going to our first frat (and leaving after 15 mins). you in your oski obsession era. having lots of sidequests in singapore together (lots of shopping, drinking, and digicam pics)!`,

    content: `Hiya, this is Kyle. Ur old now. Thanks for always being there when I have needed you, especially when I haven't been the easiest person to deal with. I look forward to us continuing our years of comradery that will likely last for our lives, whether we like it or not. I firmly believe that your efforts will allow you to accomplish great things in life. May you live long and prosper, and I hope that you will continue taking in the sheets. Guy, Kyle \n \n \n \n \n \n`,

    content: `hey bianca happy 20th old bitch. youre always slaying the house the boots the house the boots down. It's truly been a joy watching you grow as a person especially in college. I'm happiest knowing that you are happy and seeing you accomplish things you've always wanted like finding research and presenting at the owl abusers. Aside from your academics, I loved seeing you grow as a person and become more confident in yourself and growing to be less pretentious â€” something I've learned from you.`,

    content: `bianca!!!! happy birthday!!!! even though we've only known each other for like a year(?), it's one of the best things that's happened to me. i don't know how else to say it, but the weekends we spent locking in over monster and analyzing cat behavior feel intangibly significant, somehow, like they'll become nostalgic in the next ten years after graduation is over and our lives are totally differentâ€¦.
your dry delivery and wicked smarts are eternally impressive, and i hope that this year you're able to fully acknowledge your capabilities, even if you feel like an outsider or like you have nothing to offer. self-assurance is a tall order and certainly isn't happening for me any time soon, but i know you get it. i'm positive you've already got many opportunities lined up, so i'm praying this year will grant you a little respite because underneath all that brutal efficiency, there's a person who needs rest too.
i love you!!!! give circe a treat for me (or don't if she's getting too pear shaped)`,
