    content: `dear bianca, 

wishing you the best 20th ever!! we met when we were little naive 18-year olds and now weâ€™re both 20 thatâ€™s actually crazy. it feels like just yesterday we were coming to berkeley for the first time and somehow i was lucky enough to have met you as my first friend in college. from the beginning, i was drawn to you because there was something about you that made me feel so safe. i immediately felt that i could tell you anything and you wouldnâ€™t judge me. you became a constant, reliable support system and one of my biggest comforts throughout college. being your roommate was such a special part of my college experience and iâ€™m so lucky that we somehow ended up as random roomies. 

weâ€™ve shared so so many fun memories together. thereâ€™s too many to put into words, but i can try.  forcing ourselves to tolerate clark kerr food but ending up making noodles (indome and maggi>>). dressing up as white/black swan and ravenclaw/hufflepuff, then realizing how good shein is (which didnâ€™t help our already horrible self control when it comes to shopping). buying an unhealthy amount of cal jacketsâ€¦ watching things together (canâ€™t believe we lasted through an entire season of xo kitty in one sitting). going to our first frat (and leaving after 15 mins). you in your oski obsession era. having lots of sidequests in singapore together (lots of shopping, drinking, and digicam pics)!

weâ€™ve also had the most unhinged, niche conversations that somehow always made sense to us. we shared clothes like sisters. decorated our walls together, which each represented our personalities and vibes perfectly. enduring the berkeley rain together so so many times after locking in at philz. sharing some iconic places near both cupertino and monterey park (i still remember your absolute joy at experiencing santana rowâ€™s miniso for the first time). experiencing laufey in person together after failing to get tickets so many times in philz. 

youâ€™ve introduced me to so many beautiful things. so many songs! (our sabrina carpenter/laufey/niki era was so iconic). indome and djungelskog (which changed my life). took me to super fun places near your home (old town pasadena, those malls, and the best street tacos with hunter and kyle lol).

but more than all of that, i want to thank you for the way youâ€™ve always been there for me (literally since day one). although freshman year as the only 2 pocs in clark kerr (only slight exaggeration) was definitelyâ€¦ an experience? i felt assured that i always had you as a good friend, which felt really reassuring especially because we both highkey didnâ€™t vibe with half of berkeley for at least a semester. i always felt that i could turn to you for the best advice. you have a rare ability to make a space where people can be completely themselves, and thatâ€™s something i cherish so much about you. you have a beautiful sense of generosity and have always done little actions to show me that you care about me (iâ€™ve had so many of your snacks your the snackpile lol). 

thank you for being such a genuinely beautiful and inspirational person. for your unconditional loyalty, for bringing fresh perspectives into my (bay area brainwashed) mind, and for always being open to experiencing new things together. i love how we can do the most spontaneous, random things and still have the best time. your work ethic, resilience, and pure, genuine heart inspire me so much, and iâ€™m so lucky to have you in my life. 

i love you so much and i canâ€™t wait to see what new adventures you experiences in your 20â€™s! hope to celebrate many many more milestones and birthdays together (21 coming soon?)`,

I look forward to us continuing our years of comradery that will likely last for our lives, whether we like it or not. I firmly believe that your efforts will allow you to accomplish great things in life. May you live long and prosper, and I hope that you will continue taking in the sheets.

    content: `hey bianca happy 20th old bitch. youre always slaying the house the boots the house the boots down. It's truly been a joy watching you grow as a person especially in college. I'm happiest knowing that you are happy and seeing you accomplish things you've always wanted like finding research and presenting at the owl abusers. Aside from your academics, I loved seeing you grow as a person and become more confident in yourself and growing to be less pretentious â€” something I've learned from you. You've always been my number one role model and someone I go to for advice and feels like having an older sister
. You've always been the first one to take steps I couldn't see myself taking before like applying to opportunities, having a taste in music, dating, ordering food, asking for a restaurant's restroom key, finding research, speaking to teachers and profs, leading clubs, staying connected w/ old friends, being confrontational and the list goes on and on. It truly never feels like I have to do anything alone, since you've done it before and I know I can always reach out for help. In this past year alone you've helped me get through my mother's cancer diagnosis, inspired me in balancing job w/ school, provided your home as a place for the fires, and slowly supported my journey in embracing my identity as a gay fag â€” experiences I will never forget (I'm getting good at these emdashes eat it wanna be english major). I also see how much you care for others and try to mimic a fraction of that empathy and hope you treat yourself as well as you treat others. There's so much more I'd like to say but I'm too lazy. I'm eternally grateful to have met you in Carmona's class and am excited to see you grow as a person and be there with you. "I hope you're happy." HAGS old hag.`,

    content: `bianca!!!! happy birthday!!!! even though we've only known each other for like a year(?), it's one of the best things that's happened to me. i don't know how else to say it, but the weekends we spent locking in over monster and analyzing cat behavior feel intangibly significant, somehow, like they'll become nostalgic in the next ten years after graduation is over and our lives are totally differentâ€¦.
your dry delivery and wicked smarts are eternally impressive, and i hope that this year you're able to fully acknowledge your capabilities, even if you feel like an outsider or like you have nothing to offer. self-assurance is a tall order and certainly isn't happening for me any time soon, but i know you get it. i'm positive you've already got many opportunities lined up, so i'm praying this year will grant you a little respite because underneath all that brutal efficiency, there's a person who needs rest too.
i love you!!!! give circe a treat for me (or don't if she's getting too pear shaped)`,
